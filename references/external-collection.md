## Prerequisites

1. CLI installed, logged in, and cluster context set (see setup skill).
2. The target collection must already exist as an **external collection**
   (created with an `externalSource` / `externalSpec` schema in the
   collection reference). Plain in-place collections do not have refresh jobs.
3. The cluster must be running a `kite-coordinator` build that exposes
   `/v2/vectordb/jobs/external_collection/*` (PR #5735 or later). On older
   data planes the API returns 404 -- in that case ask the user to upgrade
   the cluster.

## Commands Reference

The `external-collection` resource has a single operation, `refresh`, with
three actions: `trigger`, `describe`, and `list`. All three are data-plane
calls and inherit the database from the current context unless overridden
with `--database`.

### Trigger a refresh job

```bash
zilliz external-collection refresh trigger --name <collection-name>
# Optional:
#   --database <db-name>          Override the context database
#   --external-source <src>       Override the external source registered on the collection
#   --external-spec <spec>        Override the external spec registered on the collection
```

`trigger` returns the new `jobId`. Use it with `refresh describe` to poll
status. The override flags are intentionally rare -- normally the source
and spec are pinned at collection-create time, and a plain
`refresh trigger --name <name>` is enough.

### Describe a refresh job

```bash
zilliz external-collection refresh describe --job-id <id>
```

Returns the job's state, progress, and (on failure) the error message.

### List refresh jobs

```bash
zilliz external-collection refresh list
# Optional:
#   --name <collection-name>      Filter to one external collection
#   --database <db-name>          Override the context database
```

Without filters, `list` returns recent refresh jobs scoped to the current
database. Pair with `--query` to extract a single field, e.g.:

```bash
zilliz external-collection refresh list --name my_external_coll \
  --query 'data[?state==`Pending` || state==`Running`].jobId'
```

## Guidance

- An external collection is a collection whose rows live in an external
  source (e.g. a Vector Lake table). The collection's metadata, indexes,
  and schema are in Milvus, but the data is pulled in on demand. The
  `refresh` job is what synchronises that external data into the
  collection so subsequent queries see fresh rows.
- Refresh jobs are asynchronous. After `trigger`, poll with `describe`
  until the job reaches a terminal state. Do not assume completion just
  because `trigger` returned successfully -- that only means the job was
  accepted.
- If `trigger` fails with "collection not found" or "not an external
  collection", verify with `zilliz collection describe --name <name>`
  that the collection actually has an `externalSource` field. If it
  does not, this is a normal in-place collection and refresh does not
  apply -- nothing needs to be done.
- When `describe` reports a failed job, surface the error message to the
  user verbatim. It usually points at a credentials, network, or schema
  mismatch in the external source rather than a Milvus bug.
- Avoid scheduling overlapping refresh jobs against the same collection
  -- check `list --name <name>` for an already-running job before
  triggering a new one.
- A `trigger` on a large external table can run for minutes. Do not
  hold a chat session open polling every few seconds -- give the user
  the `jobId` and explain how to come back and check `describe` later.
- For related operations on the same collection (create, drop, load,
  query) defer to the `collection` reference. This reference only covers the
  refresh lifecycle.
