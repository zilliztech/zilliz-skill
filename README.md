# Zilliz Cloud CLI Skill

A skill that teaches AI agents how to operate [Zilliz Cloud](https://zilliz.com/) and Milvus vector databases through `zilliz-cli`. Instead of memorizing CLI commands, just describe what you want:

- "Create a serverless cluster in us-east-1 and set up a collection with 768-dimension vectors"
- "Search for similar items in my product collection with filter age > 20"
- "Show me the status of all my clusters and collections"
- "Set up a daily backup policy for my production cluster with 7-day retention"
- "Create a role with read-only access to the analytics collection"
- "Import data from S3 into my embeddings collection"
- "Check the status of my import job"
- "Show me this month's usage and invoices"
- "Spin up a Vector Lake in us-east-1 and create an on-demand cluster with a 30-minute idle TTL"
- "Refresh my external collection from Vector Lake and tell me when the job finishes"
